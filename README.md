# GenAI_project
## GenAI for Humanists (Capstone Project)
*Done by Felix Aufreiter*

The primary goal of this project is to create a generative AI-driven pipeline that supports Spanish language learners in improving their writing skills. This system will automatically analyse students' written texts, identifying linguistic mistakes and assessing their overall proficiency according to the *Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL)* and the available grading schemes of the *BMBWF*.
 
Based on this analysis, the system will generate personalised practice exercises that focus on the specific areas where each student struggles, ensuring targeted and effective learning. These new exercises will be accompanied by detailed solutions. Students will be provided with the possibility to use these newly created tasks to improve their grammar skills. 

Either OpenAI API or a suitable open-source LLM will be selected as the platform for developing this pipeline with detailed prompt engineering. This project should combine generative AI and humanistic education. The aim is to use generative AI to improve the personalised support of students and help educators/teachers to create personalised exercises.
